# UCSD Unfolding Maps Coursera Completed With Extension

All the modules consist of the required things to be done completed.

For the extension part, 2 new classes and 1 new method are added to module 6 to add functionality of live fetching Corona statistics of the country who's city is selected and display that under the maps key as show in the image. If nothing is selected, it shows data of the last selected city.

*Reason for the image to have a black background is I had maxed my pings to Google Maps that day and hence they were denying my requests and the map wouldn't load.*
